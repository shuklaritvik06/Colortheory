# Color theory

Saturation & Value

- Don't Overdo it (Over saturated palettes will give a fake look to the art or design which we are making)
- Use saturation value to guide the viewer where we want

Color Harmonies

- Monochromatic -> Only one color usage, Due to the absence of other colors, the viewer is left to focus on the differing values and saturation.
- Analogous -> Analogous harmonies use colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
- Triadic -> Colors that are equally distant to each other. 
- Complimentary -> colors on opposing sides of the wheel.   (Sharp color scheme)
- Split Complimentary -> Start with one color, find its complement and then use the two colors on either side of it.
- Double Complimentary ->  when two colors are next to each other on the color wheel and are paired with two adjacent hues on the opposite side
